<b>Introduction :-- </b>


As long as we have tools and software, we need proper communication to successfully articulate the use, creation, functionality, or architecture of these products to other people. WHY? Simply because the knowledge of technical communication is essential to capture information and help the audience with a better understanding of the product or technology.

While communication in the real world is done through words or expressions, technical communication in the virtual world is done via <i>Technical Documentation!</i>

<b>Purpose :-</b> 

Technical documentation is created for the sole purpose of making it simple for the end-user to understand the work dynamics and architecture of a product or technology they use. It is more like – a detailed description of the nuts and bolts of a product – a “how-to-use” guide for your new employees, users, and anyone else who needs to know how it works!


Technical documentation refers to the documents that involve product-related information and data; it holds the details about a technical product or service that is either under development or already in use.

Simply put, technical documentation is all about presenting the product in a way that’s easy to use, read, understand, and actually help your audience. These documents are created in various industries, for example, in engineering, medicine, IT, marketing, and so on.

<b>Problems it Solves and Benefit it Provides:-</b>

Great technical documentation guides your audience and empowers them to use your product, without frustration and difficulties! Whether that audience is end-users, managers, administrators, employees, or technicians don’t really matter. What matters is that the documentation is clear, searchable, and helpful for them.

Users seek out technical documentation when they’re most in need! It helps the intended audience understand the processes and solve difficulties when using product.
